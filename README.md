## Description

The Support and Resistance Trader EA is an automated trading system that aims to identify support and resistance levels in the forex market and place trades accordingly. The EA calculates the support and resistance levels based on trading strategies, although the specific code for this calculation is not included in this sample.

Once the support and resistance levels are calculated, the EA checks if the market is at the support level or the resistance level. If the market is at the support level, a long position is opened. Conversely, if the market is at the resistance level, a short position is opened.

This EA is designed to work on the MetaTrader platform and can be used with any forex pair. It is recommended to test this EA on a demo account before using it in live trading.

## How it Works

1. The EA starts by calculating the support and resistance levels using the `CalculateSupportAndResistance()` function. Please note that the specific code for calculating these levels is not included in this sample and needs to be implemented based on your trading strategies.

2. The EA then checks if the current bid price is less than or equal to the support level. If this condition is met, a long position is opened using the `OrderSend()` function with the parameters for buying.

3. If the current ask price is greater than or equal to the resistance level, the EA opens a short position using the `OrderSend()` function with the parameters for selling.

4. The EA repeats this process in each tick of the market to continuously monitor and trade based on the support and resistance levels.
